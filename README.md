# landing-page
My attempt at creating a landing page as part of the Odin Project curriculum using HTML, CSS &amp; Flexbox


I'll be trying to recreate the reference image for the landing page using everything I've learnt so far. I'll also commit as often as I feel necessary and practice writing clear and concise commit messages.
